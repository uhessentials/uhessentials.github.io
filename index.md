## Import conventions

This system adheres to the Meteor 1.4 guideline of putting all application code in the imports/ directory, and using client/main.js and server/main.js to import the code appropriate for the client and server in an appropriate order.

This system accomplishes client and server-side importing in a different manner than most Meteor sample applications. In this system, every imports/ subdirectory containing any Javascript or HTML files has a top-level index.js file that is responsible for importing all files in its associated directory.   

Then, client/main.js and server/main.js are responsible for importing all the directories containing code they need. For example, here is the contents of client/main.js:

```
import '/imports/startup/client';
import '/imports/ui/components/form-controls';
import '/imports/ui/components/directory';
import '/imports/ui/components/user';
import '/imports/ui/components/landing';
import '/imports/ui/layouts/directory';
import '/imports/ui/layouts/landing';
import '/imports/ui/layouts/shared';
import '/imports/ui/layouts/user';
import '/imports/ui/pages/directory';
import '/imports/ui/pages/filter';
import '/imports/ui/pages/landing';
import '/imports/ui/pages/user';
import '/imports/api/base';
import '/imports/api/profile';
import '/imports/api/interest';
import '/imports/ui/stylesheets/style.css';
```

Apart from the last line that imports style.css directly, the other lines all invoke the index.js file in the specified directory.

We use this approach to make it more simple to understand what code is loaded and in what order, and to simplify debugging when some code or templates do not appear to be loaded.  In our approach, there are only two places to look for top-level imports: the main.js files in client/ and server/, and the index.js files in import subdirectories.

Note that this two-level import structure ensures that all code and templates are loaded, but does not ensure that the symbols needed in a given file are accessible.  So, for example, a symbol bound to a collection still needs to be imported into any file that references it.

## Naming conventions

## Data model

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
## CSS

=======
The BowFolios data model is implemented by two Javascript classes: [ProfileCollection](https://github.com/bowfolios/bowfolios/blob/master/app/imports/api/profile/ProfileCollection.js) and [InterestCollection](https://github.com/bowfolios/bowfolios/blob/master/app/imports/api/interest/InterestCollection.js). Both of these classes encapsulate a MongoDB collection with the same name and export a single variable (Profiles and Interests)that provides access to that collection.

Any part of the system that manipulates the BowFolios data model imports the Profiles or Interests variable, and invokes methods of that class to get or set data.

There are many common operations on MongoDB collections. To simplify the implementation, the ProfileCollection and InterestCollection classes inherit from the [BaseCollection](https://github.com/bowfolios/bowfolios/blob/master/app/imports/api/base/BaseCollection.js) class.

The [BaseUtilities](https://github.com/bowfolios/bowfolios/blob/master/app/imports/api/base/BaseUtilities.js) file contains functions that operate across both classes.

Both ProfileCollection and InterestCollection have Mocha unit tests in [ProfileCollection.test.js](https://github.com/bowfolios/bowfolios/blob/master/app/imports/api/profile/ProfileCollection.test.js) and [InterestCollection.test.js](https://github.com/bowfolios/bowfolios/blob/master/app/imports/api/interest/InterestCollection.test.js). See the section below on testing for more details.

## CSS

The application uses the [Semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com/) CSS framework. To learn more about the Semantic UI theme integration with Meteor, see [Semantic-UI-Meteor](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI-Meteor).

The Semantic UI theme files are located in [app/client/lib/semantic-ui](https://github.com/ics-software-engineering/meteor-application-template/tree/master/app/client/lib/semantic-ui) directory. Because they are located in the client/ directory and not the imports/ directory, they do not need to be explicitly imported to be loaded. (Meteor automatically loads all files into the client that are located in the client/ directory).

Note that the user pages contain a menu fixed to the top of the page, and thus the body element needs to have padding attached to it.  However, the landing page does not have a menu, and thus no padding should be attached to the body element on that page. To accomplish this, the [router](https://github.com/bowfolios/bowfolios/blob/master/app/imports/startup/client/router.js) uses "triggers" to add an remove the appropriate classes from the body element when a page is visited and then left by the user.

## Routing

## Authentication

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
## Authorization

=======
For authentication, the application uses the University of Hawaii CAS test server, and follows the approach shown in [meteor-example-uh-cas](http://ics-software-engineering.github.io/meteor-example-uh-cas/).

When the application is run, the CAS configuration information must be present in a configuration file such as  [config/settings.development.json](https://github.com/ics-software-engineering/meteor-application-template/blob/master/config/settings.development.json).

Anyone with a UH account can login and use BowFolio to create a portfolio.  A profile document is created for them if none already exists for that username.

## Authorization

The landing and directory pages are public; anyone can access those pages.

The profile and filter pages require authorization: you must be logged in (i.e. authenticated) through the UH test CAS server, and the authenticated username returned by CAS must match the username specified in the URL.  So, for example, only the authenticated user `johnson` can access the pages `http://localhost:3000/johnson/profile` and  `http://localhost:3000/johnson/filter`.

To prevent people from accessing pages they are not authorized to visit, template-based authorization is used following the recommendations in [Implementing Auth Logic and Permissions](https://kadira.io/academy/meteor-routing-guide/content/implementing-auth-logic-and-permissions).

The application implements template-based authorization using an If_Authorized template, defined in [If_Authorized.html](https://github.com/bowfolios/bowfolios/blob/master/app/imports/ui/layouts/user/if-authorized.html) and [If_Authorized.js](https://github.com/bowfolios/bowfolios/blob/master/app/imports/ui/layouts/user/if-authorized.js).

# Development History

The following sections document the development history of BowFolios.

## Milestone 1: Mockup development

This milestone started on December 6, 2016 and ended on January 31, 2017.

The goal of Milestone 1 was to create a set of HTML pages providing a mockup of the pages in the system. To simplify things, the mockup was developed as a Meteor app. This meant that each page was a template and that FlowRouter was used to implement routing to the pages. 

Mockups for the following four pages were implemented during M1:

<img width="200px" src="images/landing.png"/>
<img width="200px" src="images/profile.png"/>
<img width="200px" src="images/directory.png"/>
<img width="200px" src="images/filter.png"/>

Milestone 1 was implemented as [BowFolio GitHub Milestone M1](https://github.com/bowfolios/bowfolios/milestone/1)::

Milestone 1 consisted of five issues, and progress was managed via the [BowFolio GitHub Project M1](https://github.com/bowfolios/bowfolios/projects/1):

![](images/m1-project.png)

Each issue was implemented in its own branch, and merged into master when completed:

## Milestone 2: Data model development 

## Milestone 3: Connect UI to data model

## Milestone 4: Authentication

## Milestone 5: Administration

=======
To run the unit tests on the data model, invoke the script named 'test', which is defined in the package.json file:

```
meteor npm run test
```

This outputs the results to the console. Here is an example of a successful run, with timestamps removed:

```
[~/github/bowfolios/bowfolios/app]-> meteor npm run test

> bowfolios@ test /Users/philipjohnson/github/bowfolios/bowfolios/app
> TEST_WATCH=1 meteor test --driver-package meteortesting:mocha

[[[[[ Tests ]]]]]                             

=> Started proxy.                             
=> Started MongoDB.  

(STDERR) Note: you are using a pure-JavaScript implementation of bcrypt.
(STDERR) While this implementation will work correctly, it is known to be
(STDERR) approximately three times slower than the native implementation.
(STDERR) In order to use the native implementation instead, run
(STDERR)
(STDERR)   meteor npm install --save bcrypt
(STDERR)
(STDERR) in the root directory of your application.

Load the app in a browser to run client tests, or set the TEST_BROWSER_DRIVER environment variable. See https://github.com/DispatchMe/meteor-mocha/blob/master/README.md#run-app-tests
```


### JSDoc

BowFolios supports documentation generation with [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/). The package.json file defines a script called jsdoc that runs JSDoc over the source files and outputs html to the ../../bowfolio.github.io/jsdoc directory.  When committed, the index.html file providing an overview of all the documentation generate at that point in time is available at [http://bowfolios.github.io/jsdocs](https://bowfolios.github.io/jsdocs/).
