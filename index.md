# Development History

The following sections document the development history of BowFolios.

## Milestone 1: Mockup development

This milestone started on December 6, 2016 and ended on January 31, 2017.

The goal of Milestone 1 was to create a set of HTML pages providing a mockup of the pages in the system. To simplify things, the mockup was developed as a Meteor app. This meant that each page was a template and that FlowRouter was used to implement routing to the pages. 

Mockups for the following four pages were implemented during M1:

<img width="200px" src="images/profile.png"/>
<img width="200px" src="images/directory.png"/>
<img width="200px" src="images/filter.png"/>

Milestone 1 was implemented as [BowFolio GitHub Milestone M1](https://github.com/bowfolios/bowfolios/milestone/1)::

Milestone 1 consisted of five issues, and progress was managed via the [BowFolio GitHub Project M1](https://github.com/bowfolios/bowfolios/projects/1):

Each issue was implemented in its own branch, and merged into master when completed:
